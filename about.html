			<div class="about">
				<p>I'm a Northwestern computer science major concentrating in networking, machine learning, and information security. I've been programming for nine years, which has included improving Node.js/Python DevOps and developing frontend and backend features for an AI startup, a game for the iOS app store, many CS curriculum projects, and several personal projects. I'm always interested in using my leadership, communication skills, curiosity, and drive to solve new problems with other people!

					I started learning computer programming in 6th grade making simple iPhone games in Unity and Swift SpriteKit, but lately I've been splitting my development free time between learning more about React/Node.js and studying information security. I'm currently progressing through Northwestern's McCormick Computer Science degree, and am graduating in 2023.
					
					I'm excited to return to Zillow Group as a Software Development Engineer in August of 2023!</p>
