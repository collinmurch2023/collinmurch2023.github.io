			<div class="about">
				<p>Astro Brawl is an iOS arcade-style shooter game that I developed with Unity during over the summer after 6th grade.

					The basic goal of the game is to shoot the other player, however there is only one button. When on the ground, the player rocks back and forth in similarly to a rocking chair,

					and when the button is pressed, the player fires their gun and also jumps in the direction their head is pointing. This, along with the ability to jump once while airborne (this resets upon touching the ground) allows for some degree of control.

					The game continues until one of the two onscreen players (either two humans or a human and an A.I.) is eliminated, in which case the stage is changed and that player receives a point.

					The game is played until the score limit (determined before starting the game) is reached.

					As unfortunately the app is no longer on the App Store (due to a $99 yearly developer account cost), the source code has been made available below.
